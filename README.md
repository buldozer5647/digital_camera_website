Here is my webapp for posting photos made by digital camera. You can create an account using email and password or sign in with your Google account. Then you can post your vintage photos! 
Add a title, description, image description (alt text) and, surprisingly, the image. Then post it and share it with the world. Pretty cool!

The idea of it came up to my mind a long time ago, but primarily I created this project for two reasons:
- to practice convenient authentication with django-allauth and template use with Tailwind styling (because my previous commercial projects mainly used only DRF for restfull api and rn I'm a little sick of it),
- to have an open source project which I can share with recruiters.

The first 3 commits are the first version of the website, which I build in two days. I hope to maintain it and release new versions.
